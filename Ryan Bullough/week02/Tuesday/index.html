          Best known as the inventor of Cybernetics - the theoretical foundation
          which has given us servomechanisms, artificial intelligence and
          neuroscience.

          A famously neurotic individual, Wiener feared for the future based on
          two fundamental convictions
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We humans can’t resist selfishly misusing the powers our machines
            give us, to the detriment of our fellow humans and the planet.
          </li>
          <li>+</li>
          <li>
            We couldn’t control our machines even if we wanted to, because we're
            increasingly building them to make decisions on their own.

        <blockquote>
          "The world of the future will be an ever more demanding struggle
          against the limitations of our intelligence, not a comfortable hammock
          in which we can lie down to be waited upon by our robot slaves."
