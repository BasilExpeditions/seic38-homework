    ###Type:
    - Lab

    ###Summary
    - This lab will help you practice JavaScript functions and manipulating the DOM with jQuery.
    - You'll be selecting elements, manipulating HTML, and manipulating style along
    with building out the logic using JavaScript.

    ###Objectives:
    - DOM selection, appending, removal, updating

    ###Specification:

    * Keep track of the checking and savings balances somewhere
    * Add functionality so that a user can deposit money into one of the bank accounts.
    * Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page
    so a user can see the change.
    * Add functionality so that a user can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts.
    * Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page
    so a user can see the change.
    * Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to
    withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
    * When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account
    should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account.
    * What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking
    account than is in the account? These accounts have overdraft protection, so if
    a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking
    balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account.
    If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.
    * Make sure there is overdraft protection going both ways.
    * Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer?
