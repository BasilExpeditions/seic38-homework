// Bonus: Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:
// Start with a reward amount of $0
// Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
// When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.
